Using Pandas to plot and compare portfolios

Performance Analysis

Calculate and plot cumulative returns. Does any portfolio outperform the S&P 500?
Yes

Risk Analysis


Create a box plot for each of the returns. Which box has the largest spread? Which has the smallest spread?
Berckshire has biggest. Paulson and CO has smallest

Calculate the standard deviation for each portfolio. Which portfolios are riskier than the S&P 500?
Borkshire and Tiger are riskier


Rolling Statistics


Plot the rolling standard deviation of the firm's portfolios along with the rolling standard deviation of the S&P 500. Does risk increase for each of the portfolios at the same time risk increases in the S&P?
Yes

Construct a correlation table for the algorithmic, whale, and S&P 500 returns. Which returns most closely mimic the S&P?
Paulson and Co

Choose one portfolio and plot a rolling beta between that portfolio's returns and S&P 500 returns. Does the portfolio seem sensitive to movements in the S&P 500?
Yes


Plot Sharpe Ratios
Investment managers and their institutional investors look at the return-to-risk ratio, not just the returns. (After all, if you have two portfolios that each offer a 10% return, yet one is lower risk, you would invest in the lower-risk portfolio, right?)
Yes

Using the daily returns, calculate and visualize the Sharpe ratios using a bar plot.


Determine whether the algorithmic strategies outperform both the market (S&P 500) and the whales portfolios.



Create Custom Portfolio
Harold is ecstatic that you were able to help him prove that the algorithmic trading portfolios are doing so well compared to the market and whales portfolios. However, now you are wondering whether you can choose your own portfolio that performs just as well as the algorithmic portfolios. Investigate by doing the following:


Visit NASDAQ's Historical Price Data and choose 3-5 stocks for your own portfolio.


Download the data as CSV files and calculate the portfolio returns.


Add your portfolio returns to the DataFrame with the other portfolios and rerun the analysis. How does your portfolio fair?
It fairs pretty well. It is very correlated.
